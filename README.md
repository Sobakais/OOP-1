# First GitHub Repository

This is my first GitHub repository, containing a simple C++ program that demonstrates the usage of a Rectangle class. The repository includes the following files:

- main.cpp: Contains the main program that creates instances of the Rectangle class and prints out their areas and centers.
- rectangle.hpp: Contains the definition of the Rectangle class with its member functions and data members.

## Usage
To run the program, simply compile and execute the main.cpp file using a C++ compiler.

## Rectangle Class
The Rectangle class represents a rectangle shape with its horizontal and vertical lengths, as well as its bottom-left corner coordinates. The class provides methods to calculate the area and center of the rectangle.
